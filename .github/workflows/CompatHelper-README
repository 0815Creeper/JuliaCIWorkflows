CompatHelper is a Julia package that help to keep the [compat] entries of any packages Project.toml up-to-date.
It is a workaround, as there is currently no Julia support for Dependabot.

See https://juliaregistries.github.io/CompatHelper.jl/stable/

The CompatHelper.yml in this repo is a simplifyed version of the recommended CompatHelper.yml from https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/CompatHelper.jl/blob/master/.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml

The CompatHelper requires not only the automatically created GITHUB_TOKEN (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret) 
but also the environment variable COMPATHELPER_PRIV. CompatHelper creates branches and pushes changes of the Project.toml to them, so it needs access to be able to push to the repo via ssh.
COMPATHELPER_PRIV must contain a Plain Text or Base64 Encoded SSH Public Key for git pushes and API calls and can be passed to the CompatHelper workflow as a github secret.
Either reuse the SSH key, generated for the Documentation action, that is used to publish the build documentation to the github-pages, or generate a ssh keypair for CompatHelper

Creating SSH Key:
https://juliaregistries.github.io/CompatHelper.jl/dev/#Creating-SSH-Key
Generate a new SSH key
	<ssh-keygen -m PEM -N "" -f compathelper_key>
Create a new GitHub secret
	Copy the private key, <cat compathelper_key>
	Go to your repositories settings page
	Select Secrets, and New Repository Secret
	Name the secret COMPATHELPER_PRIV, paste the copied private key
Create a new deploy key
	Copy the public key, <cat compathelper_key.pub>
	Go to your repositories settings page
	Select Deploy Keys, and Add Deploy Key
	Name the deploy key COMPATHELPER_PUB, paste in the copied public key
	Ensure that the key has Write Access
Cleanup the SSH key from your computer, <rm -f compathelper_key compathelper_key.pub>
