PkgEval.jl is used to evaluate the health and compatibility of Julia packages across different versions of Julia and dependencies.
As it is not a registered Julia Package, it gets installed from https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgEval.jl.git
It is currently only available on Linux
To add it to a package, copy Eval.yml to .github/workflows/Eval.yml and provide a executable julia script as test/eval.jl, with the following contents (modified to include all variations on packages and julia versions you want to evaluate against):

using PkgEval
using myPackage
using Test

config = Configuration(; julia = "1.10", time_limit = 120 * 60);

package = Package(; name = "myPackage");

@info "PkgEval"
result = evaluate([config], [package])

@info "Result"
println(result)

@info "Log"
println(result[1, :log])

@test result[1, :status] == :ok
